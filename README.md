Tools Used:

SQL: The data analysis and visualization are performed using SQL queries.
Excel: The dashboard may be created and visualized in Excel, incorporating the results from SQL queries.
Expected Output:
The output of the project is a dynamic dashboard that provides stakeholders with actionable insights into the pizza sales performance. It enables users to track KPIs, identify trends, and make informed decisions to optimize business strategies and improve profitability.
